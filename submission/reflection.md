# ‚úç Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
For the WeatherWise project, I primarily used Claude as my AI assistant. Claude helped me implement core functionality, design data visualizations, create the user interface, and debug code. The AI was particularly valuable for implementing pattern matching algorithms in the NLP module and creating visualizations that required detailed matplotlib configuration.

## Prompting Techniques
Throughout development, I applied several intentional prompting strategies:

1. *Problem restatement*: I restated problems in my own words to ensure clarity and focus.

2. *Incremental complexity*: Starting with basic functionality before adding complexity allowed the AI to build on solid foundations.

3. *Edge case exploration*: Specifically asking about error scenarios led to implementations that handle network failures, invalid locations, and malformed API responses.

4. *Before/after comparisons*: Providing current code when requesting improvements resulted in targeted refinements.

5. *Explanation requests*: Asking the AI to explain its code helped identify potential issues not obvious from just reading the code.

## What Worked Well?
I'm particularly proud of the modular design approach. By dividing the application into distinct components (weather data retrieval, NLP, visualization, and UI), I developed and tested each module independently before integration.

This approach made development more manageable and resulted in a maintainable, extensible codebase. It also allowed focused prompting on specific components, getting more detailed responses from the AI.

The natural language interface also turned out exceptionally well, understanding a wide variety of weather-related questions.

## What Would You Do Differently?
With more time, I would implement automated unit and integration tests. I would also enhance visualizations to be more interactive, possibly using Flask or Streamlit instead of relying solely on matplotlib. Additionally, I would explore using a more sophisticated NLP approach, perhaps incorporating a small language model for question parsing.

## Final Thoughts
This project demonstrated that effective AI-assisted development requires a thoughtful partnership between human and AI. I learned that specificity matters greatly in prompting, and an iterative approach led to much better results than expecting perfect code on the first attempt. The skills developed here will be valuable for future software development projects.

# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
For the WeatherWise project, I primarily used Claude as my AI assistant. Claude helped me in multiple ways throughout the development process:
- Generating initial code structure and module organization
- Implementing complex algorithms for weather data processing and natural language parsing
- Creating data visualizations with matplotlib
- Designing an intuitive user interface
- Debugging and refining code to handle edge cases
- Documenting the code with clear comments and docstrings

The AI assistant was particularly valuable for implementing the pattern matching algorithms in the natural language processing module and for creating the visualization components that required detailed matplotlib configuration.
